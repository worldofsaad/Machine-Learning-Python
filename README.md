# Machine-Learning-Python
Basics of machine learning using an approachable, and well-known, programming language. Concepts like Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning, look into how Statistical Modeling relates to Machine Learning, and do a comparison of each. Real-life examples of Machine learning in Python 

## 1. Regression
- **Simple Linear Regression**:  Used 'ENGINESIZE' to predict Co2 Emission
- **Multiple Linear Regression**:  Used 'ENGINESIZE', 'CYLINDERS', 'FUELCONSUMPTION_HWY' & 'FUELCONSUMPTION_CITY' to predict Co2 Emission
- **Non-Linear Regression**:  Used 'China GDP from 1960 to 2014'

## 2. Classification
- **K-Nearest Neighbors**: Imagine a telecommunications provider has segmented its customer base by service usage patterns, categorizing the customers into four groups. It is a classification problem. That is, given the dataset, with predefined labels, we need to build a model to be used to predict class of a new or unknown case. The example focuses on using demographic data, such as region, age, and marital, to predict usage patterns. The target field, called custcat, has four possible values that correspond to the four customer groups, as follows: 1- Basic Service 2- E-Service 3- Plus Service 4- Total Service Our objective is to build a classifier, to predict the class of unknown cases. We will use a specific type of classification called K nearest neighbour.
- **Decision Trees**: Imagine that you are a medical researcher compiling data for a study. You have collected data about a set of patients, all of whom suffered from the same illness. During their course of treatment, each patient responded to one of 5 medications, Drug A, Drug B, Drug c, Drug x and y. The feature sets of this dataset are Age, Sex, Blood Pressure, and Cholesterol of patients, and the target is the drug that each patient responded to. It is a sample of binary classifier, and you can use the training part of the dataset to build a decision tree, and then use it to predict the class of a unknown patient, or to prescribe it to a new patient.
