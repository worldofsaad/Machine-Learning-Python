# Machine-Learning-Python
Basics of machine learning using an approachable, and well-known, programming language. Concepts like Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning, look into how Statistical Modeling relates to Machine Learning, and do a comparison of each. Real-life examples of Machine learning in Python 

## 1. Regression
- **Simple Linear Regression**:  Used 'ENGINESIZE' to predict Co2 Emission
- **Multiple Linear Regression**:  Used 'ENGINESIZE', 'CYLINDERS', 'FUELCONSUMPTION_HWY' & 'FUELCONSUMPTION_CITY' to predict Co2 Emission
